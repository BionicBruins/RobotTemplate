# Robot Template
A template for future PROS robot in CPP using OOP. This includes a Motorset that stores right and left wheels, a Robot with tank and arcade drive, and more.

## Instructions
Go back to the [root](https://github.com/BionicBruins/RobotTemplate) folder and click `Use This Template`. It has a green color. Then, follow the given instructions. On your local machine, simply clone that new repository and start making changes! You can essentially drop in methods to control the robot's basic driving, and add your own methods.
